# Package tracing

Package `tracing` provides  _header forwarding_ features.
This header forwarding is being used mainly by [`web`](https://github.com/luizaranda/go-core/tree/master/pkg/web) and [`transport`](https://github.com/luizaranda/go-core/tree/master/pkg/transport) packages to offer traceability compliance.
